# Nvim config

## Introduction

Personal NeoVim config based on [Mini.Max](https://github.com/nvim-mini/MiniMax)

## Requirements

- (Optional, but recommended) ripgrep.
- (Optional, but recommended) Terminal emulator (or GUI) with true colors and Nerd Font icons support. No need for a full Nerd font, using NerdFontsSymbolsOnly as a fallback is usually enough.

## Formatting

Uses [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) for formatting.

Command to format all lua files: ```stylua -g '*.lua' -- .```
